<h1>Model Selection Methods</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of predicting the selling price of homes based on 40 total recorded features of a house. Using multiple model selection methods and testing methods, we comb through the possible predictors in order to settle on a base model. After the base model is produced, we can begin more complicated model selection methods including transformations of predictors, response, and the combination of variables. We analyze both the base model and complex model to decipher which model is the most ideal. Analysis and creation of models are shown in the RMD file provided.
